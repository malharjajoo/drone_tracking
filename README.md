# Drone Tracking using multiple IP cameras
This project assesses the feasibility of using multiple Internet Protocol (IP)
surveillance cameras for tracking the state of a Parrot A.R. Drone in an indoor
environment. The main emphasis of this project is to attempt to replicate
an environment similar to that of a Motion Capture System, however, using
cheaper cameras and other equipment. Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) in the
visible spectrum, in contrast to Infrared (IR) LEDs or Reflective markers in
Motion Capture Systems, are placed on the hull of the Drone in a specific configuration
to enable algorithms (from Computer Vision) to be able to extract
the state information of the drone from 2D images.
The following report provides details of the setup and algorithms used. It
is then followed by an extensive evaluation of parameters of such a system and
proceeds to highlight the possible extensions and required software frameworks
for further tasks.
